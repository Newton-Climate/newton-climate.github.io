            <p> I am a PhD student at Caltech in the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, where I am funded by the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship. Studying under Professor Christian Frankenberg, my main research is in understanding the impact of methane on our climate (from the atmospheric chemistry perspective) and how to better monitor methane emissions. To this end, I apply novel techniques from remote sensing, statistical optimization, and radiative transfer, incorporating data from orbiting satellites,  ground-based laser spectrometers, and numerical chemistry models. Combining the information and methods from these techniques provides insight into the variability of and quantifies the impact of global methane emissions. <br><br>

        I am from the Bay Area, where I also went to school. My undergraduate degree was at UC Berkeley, where I was advised by Professor Bruce Buffet in Geophysics, studying computational algorithms  to model the flow of fluids. After graduation in 2016, I was employed by  Lawrence Berkeley National Lab under Dr. Daniel Feldman, where I worked on numerical radiative transfer models. I then proceeded to make the southern Migration to Pasadena for graduate school. <br><br>

        I am a blind scientist, and this has formed much of my perspective on approaching scientific problems. I aim to make science and society a better place for those with disabilities and underrepresented minorities through community involvement, public outreach, and advocacy. If you are interested in mentoring opportunities, please contact me. <br><br>

        Outside work, I train and race in marathons and triathlons. My philosophy with the swimming aspect of triathlon is to "drown forward," which is also a good philosophy for graduate school. Many people have told me that graduate school is also like running a marathon. This hypothesis is still being reviewed.</p>
